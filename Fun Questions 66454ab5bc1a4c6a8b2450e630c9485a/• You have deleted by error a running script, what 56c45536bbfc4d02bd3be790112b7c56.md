# â€¢ You have deleted by error a running script, what could you do to restore it?

If you've accidentally deleted a running script, you can potentially recover it depending on various factors. Here's a general guideline on what you can do:

1. **Check for Backup Copies**: If you have backup or version control systems in place (e.g., Git), you might be able to recover the script from a previous version. Use the version control commands or tools to check for previous versions of the script.
2. **Check Trash or Recycle Bin**: On some systems, deleted files may be moved to the trash or recycle bin. Check there to see if the script is recoverable.
3. **Stop Writing to Disk**: If the script is critical and you want to maximize your chances of recovery, avoid writing any new data to the disk where the script was deleted. This helps prevent the space previously occupied by the script from being overwritten by new data.
4. **Use Data Recovery Software**: There are data recovery tools available for various operating systems. These tools can scan your disk for deleted files and attempt to recover them. Popular options include TestDisk and PhotoRec for Linux and Windows, or Disk Drill for macOS.
5. **Check Backup Systems**: If your system has automated backup solutions in place, check if the script was included in the last backup. You can restore it from there.
6. **Contact System Administrator**: If you're working on a networked system or under the supervision of a system administrator, they might have backup procedures or logs that could help recover the script.
7. **Review Terminal History**: If you were working in a terminal and deleted the script using a command, you might find the command in your terminal history (e.g., using the `history` command in Linux). You can then re-run the command to recreate the script.
8. **Recreate from Memory**: If all else fails, you might have to recreate the script from memory. Hopefully, you have a clear understanding of what the script was supposed to do, which can make this process faster.

Remember that the chances of successful recovery depend on several factors, including how the file was deleted, whether it's been overwritten, and the specific tools and procedures available on your system. The key is to act quickly to improve your chances of recovery and to regularly back up your important files to prevent data loss in the future.
