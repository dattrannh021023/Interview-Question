# â€¢ You come across a random computer and it appears to be a command console for the universe. What is the first thing you type?

Given the hypothetical scenario where I encounter a command console for the universe, my initial action would be to prioritize understanding and gathering information about the console's capabilities and the universe it controls. To do this, I might start by typing a command to display a help or information menu. For example:

```bash
help

```

This command could potentially provide an overview of available commands and their functions within the universe control console. From there, I would proceed cautiously, exploring the console's capabilities and commands while being mindful of any potential consequences or ethical considerations associated with controlling such a vast and complex system.
