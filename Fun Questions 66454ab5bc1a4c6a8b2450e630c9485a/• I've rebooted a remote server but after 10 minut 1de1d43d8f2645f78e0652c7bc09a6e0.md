# â€¢ I've rebooted a remote server but after 10 minutes I'm still not able to ssh into it, what can be wrong?

If you've rebooted a remote server and are unable to SSH into it even after a significant amount of time has passed, several issues could be causing the problem. Here are some troubleshooting steps to help you identify and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Check Network Connectivity:**
    - Ensure that your local network/internet connection is stable and not experiencing any issues.
    - Verify that the remote server's network connection is active and there are no networking problems on its end.
2. **Check SSH Service Status:**
    - If you have alternative remote access methods (e.g., through a web-based control panel or console access), check if the SSH service (sshd) is running on the remote server. You can use commands like `ps` or `systemctl` to check its status.
    - Ensure that the SSH service is configured to start at boot. If not, you might need to start it manually.
3. **Firewall and Security Groups:**
    - If the server is hosted in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), check the firewall rules or security groups to ensure that port 22 (SSH) is open and allowing traffic from your IP address.
    - If there's a local firewall on the server (e.g., iptables or firewalld), make sure it's not blocking SSH traffic.
4. **Server Load and Resources:**
    - High server load or resource exhaustion can cause delays in SSH access. If you have other access methods (e.g., a web control panel or console), check the server's resource usage.
    - If the server is running out of memory (RAM) or experiencing high CPU usage, it might be unresponsive.
5. **Check SSH Configuration:**
    - Review the SSH server configuration file (`sshd_config`) on the remote server to ensure that it's correctly configured. Common issues include incorrect settings or port changes.
    - If you made recent changes to the SSH configuration, make sure they are valid.
6. **Remote Server Logs:**
    - Check the server's system logs and SSH logs for any error messages or issues. The logs are typically located in `/var/log` and may include files like `auth.log`, `secure`, or `messages`.
    - Look for any unusual log entries or error messages that could indicate the cause of the problem.
7. **Server Provider's Console (if applicable):**
    - If the remote server is hosted by a cloud provider, such as AWS or Azure, use the provider's management console to access the server and troubleshoot from there.
8. **ISP or Network Issues:**
    - In rare cases, network issues between your local machine and the remote server's data center could be causing the problem. Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to inquire about any network issues.
9. **Firewall on Your Local Machine:**
    - Ensure that a firewall or security software on your local machine is not blocking outgoing SSH traffic.
10. **DNS Resolution:**
    - Ensure that the DNS records for the remote server are correct and up-to-date. Incorrect DNS settings can lead to delays in connectivity.
11. **SSH Key Authentication:**
    - If you're using SSH key authentication, make sure your private key is accessible and has the correct permissions on your local machine.
12. **Timeout Settings:**
    - Some network configurations might have aggressive timeout settings. If possible, try connecting from a different network or location to see if that resolves the issue.

If you've gone through these troubleshooting steps and still can't SSH into the server, it may be necessary to contact your hosting provider or data center for further assistance, especially if the server is hosted in a remote facility. They can perform diagnostics and check the physical status of the server if needed.
