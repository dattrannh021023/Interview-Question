# • Explain the following command (date ; ps -ef | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l ) >> Activity.log

The given command is a combination of several Unix/Linux commands, and it is used to log some system activity into a file named `Activity.log`. Let's break down the command step by step:

1. `date`: This command prints the current date and time to the standard output.
2. `;`: The semicolon `;` is used to separate multiple commands on a single line. In this case, it separates the `date` command from the rest of the commands.
3. `ps -ef`: This command is used to list all running processes on the system, along with detailed information about each process.
4. `|`: The pipe `|` symbol is used to take the output (stdout) of the command on its left and use it as the input (stdin) for the command on its right.
5. `awk '{print $1}'`: This `awk` command processes the output of `ps -ef`. It extracts the first column (the user's username or UID) of each line and prints it.
6. `sort`: This command sorts the list of usernames or UIDs alphabetically.
7. `uniq`: This command removes duplicate lines from the sorted list. In this context, it ensures that each unique username or UID is counted only once.
8. `wc -l`: This command counts the number of lines in its input. It is used to count the number of unique usernames or UIDs obtained after sorting and removing duplicates.
9. `>> Activity.log`: This part of the command redirects the output of the entire pipeline to the file named `Activity.log` in append mode. It appends the result to the end of the file, creating the file if it doesn't exist.

So, when you run this command, it does the following:

1. Prints the current date and time.
2. Lists all running processes, extracts their usernames or UIDs, sorts them, removes duplicates, and counts the unique entries.
3. Appends the result (current date and the count of unique usernames/UIDs) to the `Activity.log` file.

The `Activity.log` file will contain a timestamp followed by the number of unique usernames or UIDs each time this command is executed.
