# â€¢ What is Jenkins/TeamCity/GoCI used for?

Jenkins, TeamCity, and GoCD are continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools used in the software development and DevOps processes. They help automate various aspects of building, testing, and deploying software. Here's an overview of what each tool is used for:

1. **Jenkins**:
    - Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is widely used for building, deploying, and automating software projects.
    - It supports a vast number of plugins and integrations, making it highly customizable and suitable for various use cases.
    - Jenkins provides support for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications.
    - It is known for its flexibility and extensibility, allowing users to create custom workflows to meet specific project requirements.
2. **TeamCity**:
    - TeamCity is a commercial CI/CD server developed by JetBrains.
    - It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to set up, making it a popular choice for development teams.
    - TeamCity provides support for building, testing, and deploying code, and it offers features like build pipelines, version control integration, and extensive reporting.
    - It also supports integration with various build tools and version control systems.
3. **GoCD**:
    - GoCD is an open-source CI/CD server developed by ThoughtWorks.
    - It is designed to provide a clear visualization of the end-to-end delivery pipeline, making it easy to understand and manage complex workflows.
    - GoCD emphasizes modeling and defining pipelines as code, making it suitable for teams practicing infrastructure as code (IaC).
    - It supports parallel and sequential execution of tasks and provides traceability and visibility into the status of each stage in the pipeline.

In summary:

- **Jenkins** is a highly extensible open-source CI/CD automation server with a large and active community.
- **TeamCity** is a user-friendly commercial CI/CD server developed by JetBrains, known for its ease of use.
- **GoCD** is an open-source CI/CD server designed for clear pipeline visualization and modeling as code.

The choice of CI/CD tool depends on factors such as team preferences, project requirements, integration needs, and budget considerations. Each tool has its strengths and may be better suited for specific scenarios.
