# â€¢ What is a dynamically/statically linked file?

Dynamically and statically linked files refer to how executable programs or shared libraries are linked with other code and libraries in a software application. The key difference lies in how dependencies are managed:

1. **Statically Linked File**:
    - In a statically linked file, all the necessary code and libraries required to run an application are combined into a single executable file.
    - This means that the application does not rely on external libraries or shared objects at runtime.
    - The resulting executable file is typically larger in size because it includes all dependencies.
    - Statically linked executables are more self-contained and do not rely on the presence of specific libraries on the target system.
    - Statically linked applications tend to be more portable because they carry their dependencies with them, but they can also consume more disk space.
2. **Dynamically Linked File**:
    - In a dynamically linked file, an application is linked to external libraries (shared objects or DLLs) at runtime rather than at compile time.
    - This means that the application relies on the presence of specific libraries on the target system to run successfully.
    - Dynamically linked executables are generally smaller in size because they only include the code specific to the application itself, while dependencies are resolved at runtime.
    - Changes or updates to shared libraries can be applied system-wide without recompiling the application.
    - Dynamically linked applications can be more memory-efficient because multiple applications can share the same instance of a library in memory.
    - However, they may require more careful management of library versions to avoid compatibility issues.

In summary, the choice between dynamic and static linking depends on factors like application size, portability, ease of distribution, and system dependencies. Some systems and programming languages offer the flexibility to use both methods, allowing developers to choose the approach that best suits their needs.
