# â€¢ What does "./configure && make && make install" do?

The "./configure && make && make install" command sequence is commonly used in the process of building and installing software from source code on Unix-like systems, including Linux. Here's what each part of this sequence does:

1. **./configure**:
    - The "./configure" command is typically a script or executable included with the source code of the software.
    - When you run "./configure," it analyzes your system and checks for various dependencies and settings required to build the software.
    - It generates a "Makefile" that contains instructions on how to compile and link the software on your specific system.
    - If any required dependencies are missing or configuration options are incorrect, "./configure" will typically report an error and provide instructions on how to resolve them.
    - Once configuration is successful, the "Makefile" is created, and you can proceed to the next step.
2. **make**:
    - The "make" command reads the "Makefile" generated by "./configure" and performs the compilation and linking of the software.
    - It compiles the source code files into binary executable files and/or libraries as specified in the "Makefile."
    - During this step, the software is built based on the configuration settings and options determined by "./configure."
    - If the compilation is successful, you'll end up with executable binaries and possibly library files.
3. **make install**:
    - The "make install" command is used to copy the compiled binaries, libraries, and other necessary files to their respective system directories.
    - It typically requires superuser (root) privileges because it writes to system directories like "/usr/bin" and "/usr/lib."
    - After running "make install," the software is installed system-wide and can be used by all users on the system.

So, in summary, "./configure && make && make install" is a common sequence used to configure, compile, and install software from source code. It ensures that the software is built correctly for your specific system and is made available for use throughout the system.
